Players can leave a comment for their last session that dosnt have comment.I assume each time playes start to play a new session the session Id for that game assign to them .the Program checks if the last session Id assigned to the user doent have comment , the user will alow to leave the comment otherwise comment will be hidden.
The database used is mysql and it is on the free host and congiguration is in database.js file.
